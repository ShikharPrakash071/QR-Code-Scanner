## My process

The best possible way to build any webpage is to :

- First do a rough sketch of your webpage (landing page).
- Then find all the necessary resources which will help in building the website.
- Start building the skelton of the webpage which is :

  1. Start working with HTML
  2. Then start to add CSS one-by-one to One element at a time (USE THE TOP-DOWN APPROACH)
  3. Then start customizing the CSS with any custom properties of own.
  4. Open it with a live server and do the required customizing of the webpage.
  5. Add responsiveness to the website
     use breakpoints and media queries.
  6. After completing the website , deploy it either on Github as an repository or deploy it on Netlify so that you can showcase your work to public.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?query=outfit/) - For text styling

### Font

- Family: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)

### What I learned

Some of the major learnings while working through this project :

- Learned how to find different fonts and how to push it into our project.
- Get to know few new CSS Properties.
- Learned on the positioning of over card just right at center of our page.
- Learned about the Responsiveness behaviour of the website on different dimensions and how to manage those changes.
- Get to know about different @media queries and breakpoints used in building a professional website.
